**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?**
When you initialize a repository, git begins tracking changes to the
directory within the directory's metadata in a hidden folder. You need to
initialize repositories if you want to use the version control features
of git.

**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?**
The staging area isn't a place where your files are saved locally, and it
isn't the place where all commits are held. It's a bit of a purgatory where you
place files before committing them to the repository. It offers you a chance
to make sure you want to commit them together before officially doing so.

**How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?**
The staging area helps you make sure you only have one commit per logical
change because it allows you to commit multiple files at the same time. So,
if you change the HTML and CSS files for a website to add a single feature, you
can add both of those files to the same commit.

**What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?**
Branches are helpful, for example, when building a WordPress theme. Perhaps
you want to style that theme differently for a new client. You could add a
branch to the theme's original repo, which saves you from having to start a
new repo for a small change. You might also add a new branch if you were
changing the homepage experimentally, say to add a slider, and weren't sure
you wanted to implement that change.

**How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?**
Diagrams help me visualize the various branches in a git repo because I can see
the places where the code splits off in a new direction - kind of like a
highway. I'm pretty sure there are some Git GUIs that do this for you, so
I'm looking forward to making this even more foolproof.

**What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?**
When two branches are merged together, they effectively become a single branch.
Each separate commit it still stored in the resulting branch, as if the two
branches never existed separately. In the diagram, it's like two roads
diverging then converging, which is accurate to the way the project was coded,
even though they're just a single branch now.

**What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?**
Git's automatic merges are great because they save you time - you don't have to
hunt for differences in two branches of your code to combine them into one file.
The difficulty comes when you've significantly changed a structure in your code
such that automatic merging becomes complicated, or when git simply isn't
smart enough to know how to resolve something simple.
