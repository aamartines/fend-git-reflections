When you initialize a repository, git begins tracking changes to the
directory within the directory's metadata in a hidden folder. You need to
initialize repositories if you want to use the version control features
of git.

The staging area isn't a place where your files are saved locally, and it
isn't the place where all commits are held. It's a bit of a purgatory where you
place files before committing them to the repository. It offers you a chance
to make sure you want to commit them together before officially doing so.

The staging area helps you make sure you only have one commit per logical
change because it allows you to commit multiple files at the same time. So,
if you change the HTML and CSS files for a website to add a single feature, you
can add both of those files to the same commit.
