When you initialize a repository, git begins tracking changes to the
directory within the directory's metadata in a hidden folder. You need to
initialize repositories if you want to use the version control features
of git.

The staging area isn't a place where your files are saved locally, and it
isn't the place where all commits are held. It's a bit of a purgatory where you
place files before committing them to the repository. It offers you a chance
to make sure you want to commit them together before officially doing so.
