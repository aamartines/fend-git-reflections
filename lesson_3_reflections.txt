**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?**
Using a remote repository means your work doesn't disappear if you lose your
computer, your hard drive gets corrupted, or something similarly catastrophic
happens.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**
With a public repository, it would be kind of embarrassing if you were screwing
around in the code (or writing lazy code) and had your changes committed to the
remote repo. Someone might stumble across them when you don't want them to.
